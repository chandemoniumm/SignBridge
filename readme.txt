# SignBridge - Indian Sign Language Project

This repository contains the source code and resources for the SignBridge project focused on Indian Sign Language (ISL) technology. The project aims to develop tools for ISL hand landmark detection, bidirectional translation, and avatar rendering to improve accessibility.

## Project Structure

- Code for hand landmark detection and ISL translation models
- Data files (excluded from the repo to keep size manageable)
- Scripts for training and inference
- Utilities and helper functions

## Features

- Hand landmark detection using machine learning
- ISL translation framework
- Avatar rendering for sign language visualization

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
https://github.com/chandemoniumm/SignBridge.git
